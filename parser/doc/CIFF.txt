The CrySyS Image File Format is a proprietary, uncompressed image format. 
The format contains a header and the uncompressed pixels of the image.

Unfortunately, all libraries and modules implementing its parsing and 
display have been lost to time and faulty backups.

#  CIFF HEADER  #

All CIFF files start with a header. The header contains 7 major parts:
 ____________ ________________________ ________________________ 
|            |                        |                        |
|    magic   |       header_size      |      content_size      |
|____________|________________________|________________________|
|                        |                        |            |
|         width          |         height         | caption... |
|________________________|________________________|____________|
|                                 |
|  tags (tag1 \0 tag2 \0 ... \0)  |
|_________________________________|

	- Magic: 4 ASCII character spelling 'CIFF'
	
	- Header size: 8-byte-long integer, its value is the size of the header 
	(all fields included), i.e. the first header_size number of bytes in the 
	file make up the whole header.
	
	- Content size: 8-byte long integer, its value is the size of the image 
	pixels located at the end of the file. Its value must be width*height*3.
	
	- Width: 8-byte-long integer giving the width of the image. Its value can 
	be zero, however, no pixels must be present in the file in that case. 
	
	- Height: 8-byte-long integer giving the height of the image. Its value can 
	be zero, however, no pixels must be present in the file in that case. 
	
	- Caption: Variable-length ASCII encoded string ending with \n. It is the 
	caption of the image. As \n is a special character for the file format, the 
	caption cannot contains this character.
	
	- Tags: Variable number of variable-length ASCII encoded strings, each 
	separated by \0 characters. The strings themselves must not be multiline. 
	There must be a \0 character after the last tag as well.

The header is followed by the actual pixels of the image in RGB format, with 
each component taking up 1 byte. This part of the CIFF file must contain 
exactly content_size number of bytes.
