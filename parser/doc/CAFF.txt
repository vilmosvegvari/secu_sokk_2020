###########################################

The CrySyS Animation File Format is a proprietary file format for animating 
CIFF images. CAFF was intended to be a competitor to GIF. Unfortunately, the 
development team could not finish the parser in time, thus, GIF 
conquered the Internet. 

The format contains a number of blocks in the following format:
 __ _________________________ _______________________________
|   |                        |                               |
|ID |         length         |          data  ...            |
|___|________________________|_______________________________|

	- ID: 1-byte number which identifies the type of the block:
		0x1 - header
		0x2 - credits
		0x3 - animation

	- Length: 8-byte-long integer giving the length of the block.
	
	- Data: This section is length bytes long and contain the data of the block.


#################
#               #
#  CAFF HEADER  #
#               #
#################


The first block of all CAFF files is the CAFF header. It contains the following 
parts:
 ____________ ________________________ ________________________ 
|            |                        |                        |
|   magic    |       header_size      |        num_anim        |
|____________|________________________|________________________|

	- Magic: 4 ASCII character spelling 'CAFF'
	
	- Header size: 8-byte-long integer, its value is the size of the header 
	(all fields included).
	
	- Number of animated CIFFs: 8-byte long integer, gives the number of CIFF 
	animation blocks in the CAFF file.


##################
#                #
#  CAFF CREDITS  #
#                #
##################


The CAFF credits block specifies the creation date and time, as well as the 
creator of the CAFF file.
 ______ ___ ___ ___ ___ ________________________ ________________
|      |   |   |   |   |                        |                |
|  YY  | M | D | h | m |      creator_len       |  creator  ...  |
|______|___|___|___|___|________________________|________________|

	- Creation date and time: the year, month, day, hour and minute of the CAFF 
	file's creation:
		Y - year (2 bytes)
		M - month (1 byte)
		D - day (1 byte)
		h - hour (1 byte)
		m - minute (1 byte2
		
	- Length of creator: 8-byte-long integer, the length of the field 
	specifying the creator.
	
	- Creator: Variable-length ASCII string, the creator of the CAFF file.

The CAFF animation block contains a CIFF image to be animated. The block has 
the following fields:
 ________________ ______________ 
|                |              |
|    duration    |   CIFF  ...  |
|________________|______________|

	- Duration: 8-byte-long integer, milliseconds for which the CIFF image must
	be displayed during animation.
	
	- CIFF: the image to be displayed in CIFF format.
